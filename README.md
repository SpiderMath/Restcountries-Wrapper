# Restcountries-wrapper
Hi there üëã  
This is a simple implementation of the data provided by https://restcountries.eu  

> ‚Ñπ The package was previously an API Wrapper for [Restcountries](https://restcountries.eu), but I soon noticed that the data there has not been updated in last 4 years. So I decided instead of straining their servers for data, I'd maintain a copy of them in the package. The local data is what is used in the package  

# Import  
- ES6 Import
```ts
import { RestCountryWrapper } from "restcountries-wrapper";

const wrapper = new RestCountryWrapper();
```

- Node.js 
```js
const { RestCountryWrapper } = require("restcountries-wrapper");

const wrapper = new RestCountryWrapper;
```

# Using the Package
1. Import the class as shown in Import

2. Initialise the class (also shown)

3. Use one of the methods as documented below.

# Methods
> ### Note ‚Ñπ: All of the boolean values are always false  
<br>

- getAllCountries
	- Gets all the data

- getCountryByName
	- Parameters
		- **query** (Type: string): The name of the country you want to search for
		- **sort** (Type: boolean): Whether you want the array to be sorted by the length of the name of the country
		- **fullText** (Type: boolean): Whether the query provided is the full name of the country
	- It uses regex to find match in the country's `name`, `nativeName`, `altSpellings`, `isoCodes` & `translations`

- getCountryByLanguage
	- Parameters
		- **query**: You already know what it does
		- **sort**: You already know what it does
	- It uses regex *~~again~~* to find matches in language's `ISO Codes`, `name` & `nativeName`

- getCountryByCapital
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Here we go again?
		- **sort**: I guess we go again, always sorts countries by COUNTRY NAME though
	- It uses regex to match with capital name *~~here we go again~~*

- getCountryByISOCode
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Only accepts ISO Codes now, because the first one might be too all encompassing
		- **sort**: Same thing all the time
	- It uses regex to match with ISO Country Codes **only**

- getCountryByRegion
	- Parameters
		- **query**: The type has been set, please check it out in your editor [For lazy people, here is are the types]
		```ts
		type Region = "Africa" | "Americas" | "Asia" | "Europe" | "Oceania";
		```
		- **sort**: Usual Fare By Now NGL
	- Still uses regex because some people who use JS might misspell and regex, why not? Its better NGL

- getCountryBySubRegion
	- It is a new addition, was not present in the API
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Usual stuff
		- **sort**: Sort countries by name length

- getCountryByCurrencyCode
	- Gets countries by currency codes
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Usual query
		- **sort**: How many times to I tell this ü§® 

- getCountryByCallingCode
	- Gets countries by their calling code (Doesn't matter if you use `+` in the calling code query)
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Usual Query, no need to provide `+` of calling code
		- No **sort** here

- getCountryByRegionalBloc
	- Gets countries by their regional bloc, works on both codes and Name and Other Acronyms and Alt names
	- Parameters
		- **query**: Name of regional bloc
		- **sort**: üéâ It is back into action üòÄ 

- getCountryByTLD
	- **New** Not present in RestCountries API!
	- Parameters
		- **query**: No need to provide the `.` in the TLD, I do that for ya!
		- No **sort** here *~~again~~*
